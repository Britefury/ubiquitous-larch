class Subject (object):

	Subject

	A subject provides the content that is to be displayed within a page. It is part of the location resolution mechanism
	in which the path part of the URL is used to traverse through a hierarchy of content to find the target page.

	Subjects are built by adding steps. Each step consists of a dictionary mapping attribute names to values.
	The value of an attribute can be retrieved (getting the value for that attribute in the *LAST* step that has a value for it) either by calling
	the get_attr method or by accessing it as an attribute.
	Alternatively, an attribute value can be accumulated using the reduce method. Its operation is similar to that of the
	Python reduce function. The values that are used in the accumulation process are those obtained by retrieving
	values from each step that has a value for the attribute.

	There are a few special attributes that should be noted:

		focus - the object that is the focus of the subject
		perspective - the perspective used to present it
		location_trail - each entry should be a list of names that make up steps in the path of the URL used to access this subject. The location property generates a path from these



	Implementing location resolution

	On your objects that will be traversed while resolving a location, you can define the following methods:

	Define __resolve__ to loop up child objects by name; an identifier that is part of the URL, between the slahes
	def __resolve__(self, name, subject):
		target = self.look_up_child_content(name)
		if target is not None:
			# add a step the subject, setting the focus to the target:
			subject.add_step(focus=target)
			return target
		else:
			# Target not found; return None
			return None

	For example, packages within a project define a __resolve__ method that looks up the child entity of that name


	Define __resolve_self__ to 'forward' to a child object
	def __resolve_self__(self, subject):
		subject.add_step(focus=self.child)
		return self.child

	For example, pages within a project define __resolve_self__ to 'forward' to the content within the page.
